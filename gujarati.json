            "description": "A popular radio personality with an aversion to love meets two men with differing views on romance. RJ Antara is an FM radio disc jockey in Ahmedabad. She is against love and relationships initially and tells her boss K, Krishna, that she would never fall in love. She wins an award for the youngest RJ achiever when she meets Aaditya, a rich businessman. Aaditya had earlier been stuck in heavy traffic and observed Antara helping in clearing the traffic. Gradually, they became best friends and Aditya genuinely wanted to see her happy. Their friendship was rumored in a news magazine as a love story. Antara gets a call from Swati, who asked her what to answer as her boyfriend Sagar, who was going to propose to her on Valentine's Day. Antara asked Swati to listen to her heart and break up with Sagar if she is not happy and doesn't see any future with him. Convinced, Swati rejected Sagar's proposal and breaks up with him. Sagar learns that the breakup was because of Antara's advice and he decides to take revenge on her. Sagar, and his photographer friend, hope to publish a picture of Antara and Sagar together to ruin Antara's reputation. The two of them blackmail Antara's producer and learn that she is taking a trip to Diu, India. Sagar joins her on the bus, befriends her but falls in love with her as he starts spending time with her on the trip. Sagar then asks his friend to avoid posting the photos until he tells him to do so. Antara also falls for Sagar. Sagar invites Antara to a birthday party at his home, where she goes to Sagar's room and finds the pictures of her trip with Sagar on his laptop and realizes that he was using her for some motive. She becomes angry, thinking that Sagar was just using her to become famous. When she leaves, Sagar tries to stop her and reveals that his anger is from his rejection by Swati. Antara tells Sagar not to talk with her henceforth. Aaditya, learning about Sagar and Antara's Diu trip, calls Sagar to his office to warn him to stay away from Antara. Aaditya proposes marriage to Antara but she doesn't immediately respond. Sagar calls her on her radio line to say that, without her, his life has become monotonous and he misses her. Antara ignores Sagar's calls and messages and agrees to marry Aditya. Sagar learns of this and goes to Antara's office, but her boss Krishna tells Sagar to stay away from Antara and avoid hurting her more. Because Antara refuses to respond to Sagar's calls and messages, he sends her a letter asking whom she remembers the most when she gets up in the morning, when drinking coffee and when listening to songs online. Sagar's friend tells him that his boss is planning to post all the trip pictures in the newspaper on her wedding day to defame Antara. This makes Sagar tense, but he somehow manages to delete all the pictures from the boss' laptop with the help of his friend and snatches the pen-drive with the backup, and throws it into the lake. Aaditya happens to read Sagar's letter at Antara's home and realizes that she is not happy with the marriage proposal. Despite his questions, Antara chooses to stay quiet and wants to marry Aaditya. During the marriage ceremony, Aaditya meets Antara and asks her to say the truth about whom she really thinks of in her mind. When she cannot answer, he tells her that his aim was to see her happy, whether with him or with anyone else. They leave the wedding ceremony and return to her radio station where she asks the city to help find Sagar. Antara gets help from a tea vendor where Sagar is sitting. Antara arrives and proposes to Sagar, saying that she wants to forget her earlier anger and wants to start a new relationship with him, which Sagar happily accepts. Then, Sagar thanks Aaditya for such a huge sacrifice of his life.",
